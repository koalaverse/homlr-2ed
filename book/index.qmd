# Welcome {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the second edition of *Hands-On Machine Learning with R*. This book is undergoing heavy restructuring and may be confusing or incomplete; however, we hope for the first draft to be completed by the fall of 2023. You can find the complete first edition at [bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/).
