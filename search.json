    "text": "Welcome\nWelcome to the second edition of Hands-On Machine Learning with R. This book provides hands-on modules for many of the most common machine learning methods to include:\nYou will learn how to build and tune these various models with R packages that have been tested and approved due to their ability to scale well. However, our motivation in almost every case is to describe the techniques in a way that helps develop intuition for its strengths and weaknesses. For the most part, we minimize mathematical complexity when possible but also provide resources to get deeper into the details if desired."

    "text": "Who should read this\nWe intend this work to be a practitioner’s guide to the machine learning process and a place where one can come to learn about the approach and to gain intuition about the many commonly used, modern, and powerful methods accepted in the machine learning community. If you are familiar with the analytic methodologies, this book may still serve as a reference for how to work with the various R packages for implementation.\nThis book is not meant to be an introduction to R or to programming in general; as we assume the reader has familiarity with the R language to include defining functions, managing R objects, controlling the flow of a program, and other basic tasks. If not, we would refer you to R for Data Science (Wickham and Grolemund 2016) to learn the fundamentals of data science with R such as importing, cleaning, transforming, visualizing, and exploring your data. For those looking to advance their R programming skills and knowledge of the language, we would refer you to Advanced R (Wickham 2014). Nor is this book designed to be a deep dive into the theory and math underpinning machine learning algorithms. Several books already exist that do great justice in this arena (i.e. Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009), Computer Age Statistical Inference (Efron and Hastie 2016), Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016)).\nInstead, this book is meant to help R users learn to use the machine learning stack within R, which includes using various R packages such as the tidymodels ecosystem of packages for model development, vip and pdp for model interpretation, TODO (add others as we develop) and others to effectively model and gain insight from your data. The book favors a hands-on approach, growing an intuitive understanding of machine learning through concrete examples and just a little bit of theory. While you can read this book without opening R, we highly recommend you experiment with the code examples provided throughout."

    "section": "Why R",
    "text": "Why R\nIn this book we focus on implementing machine learning tasks with R. R has emerged over the last couple decades as a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, and has been a consistent leader in implementing statistical methodologies for analyzing data. The usefulness of R for data science stems from the large, active, and growing ecosystem of third-party packages. We are not ignoring other languages such as Python or Julia because we think these tools are inferior. They’re not! And in practice, most organizations and data science teams use a mix of languages. In fact, throughout this book we may reference methods or implementations in other languages and we may even provide a few examples in Python. However, we strongly believe that it’s best to master one tool at a time, and R is a great place to start."

Throughout the chapters we try to include many of the resources that we have found extremely useful for digging deeper into the methodology and applying with code. However, due to print restrictions, the hard copy version of this book limits the concepts and methods discussed. Online supplementary material exists at https://koalaverse.github.io/homlr/. The additional material will accumulate over time and include extended chapter material (i.e., random forest package benchmarking) along with brand new content we couldn’t fit in (i.e., random hyperparameter search). In addition, you can download the data used throughout the book, find teaching resources (i.e., slides and exercises), and more."

    "text": "1.1 Supervised learning\nA predictive model is used for tasks that involve the prediction of a given output (or target) using other variables (or features) in the data set. Or, as stated by Kuhn and Johnson (2013, 26:2), predictive modeling is “…the process of developing a mathematical tool or model that generates an accurate prediction.” The learning algorithm in a predictive model attempts to discover and model the relationships among the target variable (the variable being predicted) and the other features (aka predictor variables). Examples of predictive modeling include:\n\nusing customer attributes to predict the probability of the customer churning in the next 6 weeks;\nusing home attributes to predict the sales price;\nusing employee attributes to predict the likelihood of attrition;\nusing patient attributes and symptoms to predict the risk of readmission;\nusing production attributes to predict time to market.\n\nEach of these examples has a defined learning task; they each intend to use attributes (\\(X\\)) to predict an outcome measurement (\\(Y\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this text we’ll use various terms interchangeably for\n\n\\(X\\): “predictor variable”, “independent variable”, “attribute”, “feature”, “predictor”\n\\(Y\\): “target variable”, “dependent variable”, “response”, “outcome measurement”\n\n\n\n\nThe predictive modeling examples above describe what is known as supervised learning. The supervision refers to the fact that the target values provide a supervisory role, which indicates to the learner the task it needs to learn. Specifically, given a set of data, the learning algorithm attempts to optimize a function (the algorithmic steps) to find the combination of feature values that results in a predicted value that is as close to the actual target output as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn supervised learning, the training data you feed the algorithm includes the target values. Consequently, the solutions can be used to help supervise the training process to find the optimal algorithm parameters.\n\n\n\nMost supervised learning problems can be bucketed into one of two categories, regression or classification, which we discuss next.\n\n1.1.1 Regression problems\nWhen the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a numeric outcome, we refer to this as a regression problem (not to be confused with linear regression modeling). Regression problems revolve around predicting output that falls on a continuum. In the examples above, predicting home sales prices and time to market reflect a regression problem because the output is numeric and continuous. This means, given the combination of predictor values, the response value could fall anywhere along some continuous spectrum (e.g., the predicted sales price of a particular home could be between $80,000 and $755,000). Figure 1.1 illustrates average home sales prices as a function of two home features: year built and total square footage. Depending on the combination of these two features, the expected home sales price could fall anywhere along a plane.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Average home sales price as a function of year built and total square footage.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Classification problems\nWhen the objective of our supervised learning is to predict a categorical outcome, we refer to this as a classification problem. Classification problems most commonly revolve around predicting a binary or multinomial response measure such as:\n\nDid a customer redeem a coupon (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?\nDid a customer churn (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?\nDid a customer click on our online ad (coded as yes/no or 1/0)?\nClassifying customer reviews:\n\nBinary: positive vs. negative.\nMultinomial: extremely negative to extremely positive on a 0–5 Likert scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Classification problem modeling ‘Yes’/‘No’ response based on three features.\n\n\n\nHowever, when we apply machine learning models for classification problems, rather than predict a particular class (i.e., “yes” or “no”), we often want to predict the probability of a particular class (i.e., yes: 0.65, no: 0.35). By default, the class with the highest predicted probability becomes the predicted class. Consequently, even though we are performing a classification problem, we are still predicting a numeric output (probability). However, the essence of the problem still makes it a classification problem.\nAlthough there are machine learning algorithms that can be applied to regression problems but not classification and vice versa, most of the supervised learning algorithms we cover in this book can be applied to both. These algorithms have become the most popular machine learning applications in recent years.\n\n\n1.1.3 Knowledge check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the features, response variable, and the type of supervised model required for the following tasks:\n\nThere is an online retailer that wants to predict whether you will click on a certain featured product given your demographics, the current products in your online basket, and the time since your previous purchase.\nA bank wants to use a customers historical data such as the number of loans they’ve had, the time it took to payoff those loans, previous loan defaults, the number of new loans within the past two years, along with the customers income and level of education to determine if they should issue a new loan for a car.\nIf the bank above does issue a new loan, they want to use the same information to determine the interest rate of the new loan issued.\nTo better plan incoming and outgoing flights, an airline wants to use flight information such as scheduled flight time, day/month of year, number of passengers, airport departing from, airport arriving to, distance to travel, and weather warnings to determine if a flight will be delayed.\nWhat if the above airline wants to use the same information to predict the number of minutes a flight will arrive late or early?"

    "text": "1.2 Unsupervised learning\nUnsupervised learning, in contrast to supervised learning, includes a set of statistical tools to better understand and describe your data, but performs the analysis without a target variable. In essence, unsupervised learning is concerned with identifying groups in a data set. The groups may be defined by the rows (i.e., clustering) or the columns (i.e., dimension reduction); however, the motive in each case is quite different.\nThe goal of clustering is to segment observations into similar groups based on the observed variables; for example, to divide consumers into different homogeneous groups, a process known as market segmentation. In dimension reduction, we are often concerned with reducing the number of variables in a data set. For example, classical linear regression models break down in the presence of highly correlated features. Some dimension reduction techniques can be used to reduce the feature set to a potentially smaller set of uncorrelated variables. Such a reduced feature set is often used as input to downstream supervised learning models (e.g., principal component regression).\nUnsupervised learning is often performed as part of an exploratory data analysis (EDA). However, the exercise tends to be more subjective, and there is no simple goal for the analysis, such as prediction of a response. Furthermore, it can be hard to assess the quality of results obtained from unsupervised learning methods. The reason for this is simple. If we fit a predictive model using a supervised learning technique (i.e., linear regression), then it is possible to check our work by seeing how well our model predicts the response Y on observations not used in fitting the model. However, in unsupervised learning, there is no way to check our work because we don’t know the true answer—the problem is unsupervised!\nDespite its subjectivity, the importance of unsupervised learning should not be overlooked and such techniques are often used in organizations to:\n\nDivide consumers into different homogeneous groups so that tailored marketing strategies can be developed and deployed for each segment.\nIdentify groups of online shoppers with similar browsing and purchase histories, as well as items that are of particular interest to the shoppers within each group. Then an individual shopper can be preferentially shown the items in which he or she is particularly likely to be interested, based on the purchase histories of similar shoppers.\nIdentify products that have similar purchasing behavior so that managers can manage them as product groups.\n\nThese questions, and many more, can be addressed with unsupervised learning. Moreover, the outputs of unsupervised learning models can be used as inputs to downstream supervised learning models.\n\n1.2.1 Knowledge check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the type of unsupervised model required for the following tasks:\n\nSay you have a YouTube channel. You may have a lot of data about the subscribers of your channel. What if you want to use that data to detect groups of similar subscribers?\nSay you’d like to group Ohio counties together based on the demographics of their residents.\nA retailer has collected hundreds of attributes about all their customers; however, many of those features are highly correlated. They’d like to reduce the number of features down by combining all those highly correlated features into groups."
